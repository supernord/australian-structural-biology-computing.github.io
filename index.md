This website is a virtual meeting place and hub for all users of **computing for structural biology research in Australia**. This is a collective community effort. It can be what we make it!

## Community talk series for 2026

Starting this year, speakers from across the structural biology community will be invited to present their work at the regular community meetings. The current plan is for there to be five of these meetings every year.  


#### Next meeting is on July 29th
